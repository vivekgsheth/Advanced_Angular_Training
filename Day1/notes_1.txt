------------- Change Detection -------------
-Detects the comp for data chagne & re renders 
-Every component has its own change detector [1:1]
-We can detach it so the data will not be in sync
-It will ONLY work on COMPONENT not particular VARIABLES.
-Normally, Angular runs ChangeDetector on its own, but it will run whenever any 3 of these will happen:
	1. An event such as click, submit gets fired.
	2. XHR call to work with an API.
	3. Asynchronous JavaScript functions such as setTimeOut() or setInterval() gets executed.
-ngZone (zone.js):
	--It makes an event as ASYNC event
	--Whichever events are part of ngZone can use event binding
	--We can write code to make third party events a part of ngZone
-Traversal: Unidirectional, Top to Bottom

--Types of changedetection stratergy:
	1. Default: Whenever data changes in @Input() decorated properties, CD runs.
	2. OnPush: Whenever new reference(new object) is passed in @Input() decorated prop, CD runs.
-NOTE:  If CD is stopped at one level it will not run for below childs as well.
-IMP:	We can create a click event explicitly for calling CD when stratergy is OnPush rather than passing new obj everytime

---Reducing no of checks in change detector:
-Use OnPush stratergy & have a explicit a btn to refresh the data or pass a new obj
-

----ChangeDetectorRef
--detectChanges(): runs the CD right now for this as well as all its CHILD components.[DOWNWARD]
--markForCheck(): makes this as well as all its PARENT components as dirty, it will run CD next time.[UPWARD]
--detach(): detach CD
--reattach(): attach CD
--

--Best approach:
-OnPush stratergy
-create Observable & also unsubscribe it on ngOnDestroy()
-use markForCheck()

----- async pipe (observable type) ------
-subscribe
-manually run CD
-unsubscribe
IMP: It will always use markForCheck() & it can only be used in template


--Smart component: Container - API calls 
--Dumb component: Presenter - gets data from parent & display

Doubts:
--scenario 1				--scenario 2
-Btn click : C2 			-Btn click : C211
-OnPush: C21				-OnPush: C21
-Will CD run for C211?			-Will CD run for C211?
